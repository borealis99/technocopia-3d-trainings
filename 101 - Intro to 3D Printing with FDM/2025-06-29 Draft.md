# Prerequisites

Students are strongly encouraged to install PrusaSlicer on their personal computers. Computers are available for use in the Classroom area.

# The Basics

### What will we cover today?
### What won't we cover today?
### What is 3D Printing?
All 3D printing is layers. In a FDM (or FFF) 3D printer, a long string of plastic is fed into the nozzle. The nozzle heats the plastic and deposits it in lines to trace the shape of layers. The plastic is then rapidly cooled to provide a solid foundation for the next layer. 
### Setting Up a Successful Print
- flat on the bed
- overhangs
- details larger than nozzle
- weakest vertically
- Print failures happen. That's life. Sometimes they even break the machine. That's life. If it's clear the user didn't follow procedure, there may be further action taken.
### Safety

* 3D prints are **NOT** waterproof
* 3D prints are **NEVER** food safe, despite material datasheets or manufacturer claims

* Never touch a moving machine. This one's obvious but important.
* Melted plastic is hot. This one's should also be obvious.

* Always look on-screen to check the temperature of the bed before touching the machine. (These are in Celsius).
- On Prusa machines, the emergency stop is located directly below the knob.

# Our Printers
This training will cover the use of our two Prusa MK4S printers. Treat these as the default, and make every effort to print on these. One MK4S is soon to be equipped with an automatic material changer for multi-color prints. Incoming we have a Voron 300 for larger prints. 
# Parts of a 3D Printer
- The y-axis shakes the whole work piece, so it's important to orient narrow objects properly!
- The steel sheet is removable from the printer. Do not print without the sheet!

# Materials
Three main materials. PLA, PETG, ABS.
PLA for ease of printing, will melt in a hot car. ABS is strong and resilient, but really hard to print. PETG is a good balance.
