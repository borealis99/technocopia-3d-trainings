# The Basics

### What will we cover today?
### What won't we cover today?
### What is 3D Printing?
All 3D printing is layers. In a FDM (or FFF) 3D printer, a long string of plastic is fed into the nozzle. The nozzle heats the plastic and deposits it in lines to trace the shape of layers. The plastic is then rapidly cooled to provide a solid foundation for the next layer. 

### Setting Up a Successful Print
- flat on the bed
- overhangs
- details larger than nozzle
- weakest vertically

### Safety
* 3D prints are **NOT** waterproof
* 3D prints are **NEVER** food safe, despite material datasheets or manufacturer claims
* Never touch a moving machine. This one's obvious but important.

* Always look on-screen to check the temperature of the bed before touching the machine.
* On Prusa machines, the emergency stop is located directly below the knob.
