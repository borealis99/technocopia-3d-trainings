# The Basics
### What is 3D Printing?
All 3D printing is layers. In a FDM (or FFF) 3D printer, a long string of plastic is fed into the nozzle. The nozzle heats the plastic and deposits it in lines to trace the shape of layers. The plastic is then rapidly cooled to provide a solid foundation for the next layer.
