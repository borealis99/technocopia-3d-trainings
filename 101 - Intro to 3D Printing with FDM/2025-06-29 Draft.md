# Prerequisites

Students are strongly encouraged to install PrusaSlicer on their personal computers. Computers are available for use in the Classroom area.

# The Basics

### What will we cover today?
### What won't we cover today?
### What is 3D Printing?
All 3D printing is layers. In a FDM (or FFF) 3D printer, a long string of plastic is fed into the nozzle. The nozzle heats the plastic and deposits it in lines to trace the shape of layers. The plastic is then rapidly cooled to provide a solid foundation for the next layer. 
### Setting Up a Successful Print
- flat on the bed
- overhangs
	- Two models, oriented correctly to the build plate, seemingly fine. ![[front-overhang.png]]
	- If we look at the bottom, we can see large areas of unsupported plastic. In Slice Mode, PrusaSlicer highlights them in blue. ![[below-overhang.png]]
	- We can go to the right side of the screen and change "Supports" from "None" to "On Build Plate" and re-slice. This generates a scaffolding for the previously unsupported plastic. The scaffolding is colored green in this image. ![[below-support.png]]
	- Here are the models shown once again from the front, now with Supports enabled. ![[front-support.png]]
- details should be no less than the nozzle size ![[detail-levels.png]]
- parts are weakest vertically -- they'll split between layers if force is applied vertically
- Print failures happen. That's life. Sometimes they even break the machine. That's life. If it's clear the user didn't follow procedure, there may be further action taken.
### Safety

* 3D prints are **NOT** waterproof
* 3D prints are **NEVER** food safe, despite material datasheets or manufacturer claims

* Never touch a moving machine. This one's obvious but important.
* Melted plastic is hot. This one's should also be obvious.

* Always look on-screen to check the temperature of the bed before touching the machine. (These are in Celsius).
- On Prusa machines, the emergency stop is located directly below the knob.

# Our Printers
This training will cover the use of our two Prusa MK4S printers. Treat these as the default, and make every effort to print on these. One MK4S is soon to be equipped with an automatic material changer for multi-color prints. Incoming we have a Voron 300 for larger prints. 
# Parts of a 3D Printer
- The y-axis shakes the whole work piece, so it's important to orient narrow objects properly!
- The steel sheet is removable from the printer. Do not print without the sheet!

# Materials
Three main materials. PLA, PETG, ABS.
PLA for ease of printing, will melt in a hot car. ABS is strong and resilient, but really hard to print. PETG is a good balance.

# Running a Print
### Prepare the Bed
To prepare the bed for printing:
  1. Ensure a steel sheet is present. Do not operate the printer with the heater exposed.
  2. Lightly rub the sheet with a Scotch-Brite pad.
  3. Squirt alcohol onto a paper towel and wipe the bed clean. The alcohol will dry on its own as the bed heats up.

### Load Your Filament
- select
- snip at angle
- feed through tube

  1. On the home screen of the printer, select Filament > Load Filament. If filament is already loaded and you wish to use different filament, select Change Filament.
  2. Select your filament from the list of filament types.
  3. With the cutters, cut your filament at an angle as shown. ==Instructor: Have a picture ready of a properly cut filament end.==
  4. Place your filament roll on the holder, and push the end into the tube, as marked by the arrow.
  5. Continue pushing the filament through the tube until the printer screen changes.

### Run the File

1. Insert the flash drive in the USB port on the right side of the screen.
2. The printer will load the newest file on the drive. 
3. The printer will display an error for common mistakes (such as if the file was sliced for a different printer model, nozzle, or filament).
